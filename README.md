# Expo-graphics-Simple-Example
A actually working expo-graphics example

To start the project:
```
npm install
expo start
```

I found that `expo-graphics` DOES NOT work with the current expo sdk v31. Upgrading expo-three, three, and expo-graphics are just a hot mess that you should not avoid. Incompatibility and missing dependency will make you suffer. I experience that. It is not a good one. It makes me feel expo is just not stable enough for production usage. 

I mainly test on Android Pie.
